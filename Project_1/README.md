# System C Hello World


In this example, we see that creating modules is straightforward

`SC_MODULE(Incredible_Machine)` for example makes a module called `Incredible_Machine` in this case

`SC_CTOR(Incredible_Machine)` is how you invoke the constructor for that module -- works the same way as other OOP constructors.


You can add other functions (`say_hello` was from the referenced tutorial, and I added `open_magic_box`)

Lasyly the main function is called `sc_main` but resembles C and C++ main syntax.
